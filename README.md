# Express API with Upstash Redis and OpenAI Integration

This project demonstrates the integration of an Express API with Upstash Redis for chat message storage and OpenAI for natural language processing. The API processes user inputs using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, stores chat history in Upstash Redis, and provides a response.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- Upstash Redis account with URL and Token
- OpenAI API Key

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/harshpathakzz/LangchainJs-Upstash-Redis.git
   cd LangchainJs-Upstash-Redis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory. You can use the provided `.env.example` file as a template. Replace the placeholders with your actual Upstash Redis URL, Upstash Token, and OpenAI API Key.

   ```
   UPSTASH_URL=YOUR_UTSTASH_URL
   UPSTASH_TOKEN=YOUR_UPSTASH_TOKEN_HERE
   OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
   ```

4. Run the Express server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoint

### Process User Input

- **Endpoint:** `POST /process-input`
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
    "sessionId": "123",
    "input": "What is my name?"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "response": "Generated response from the OpenAI model"
  }
  ```

## Usage

Send a POST request to the `/process-input` endpoint with the `API_KEY`, `sessionId`, and `input` parameters to receive a response generated by the OpenAI model. Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with a valid API key.
